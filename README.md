# 🛡️ Cyber Security Projects

This repository is a collection of my hands-on cybersecurity projects, focused on networking, encryption, and secure development practices.

## 📂 Projects Included

### 1. 🔐 Secure-Storage-App
**Folder:** `Secure-Storage-App/`  
A secure file storage application that uses encryption to protect sensitive data at rest.

**Key Highlights:**
- File encryption using strong cryptographic algorithms
- Password-based access control
- Secure handling of user input and stored data

**Tech Stack:**
- Language: (e.g. Python / Java / etc.)
- Libraries/Tools: (e.g. PyCrypto, OpenSSL, etc.)

### 2. 📡 Network-Packet-Sniffer
**Folder:** `Network-Packet-Sniffer/`  
A network packet sniffer that captures and analyzes network traffic to identify common protocols and potential anomalies.

**Key Highlights:**
- Captures live packets from network interfaces
- Parses and displays packet details (IP, TCP/UDP, etc.)
- Useful for learning packet structure and basic network forensics

**Tech Stack:**
- Language: (e.g. Python)
- Libraries/Tools: (e.g. Scapy, Wireshark for verification)
